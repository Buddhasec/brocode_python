## Learning Strategy

1. **Learning Phase** (current)
- I follow a Python tutorial step-by-step.
- Code is written with inline comments to support learning.

2. **Review & Refactor Phase** (planned)
- Once the tutorial is completed, I will revisit every file and commit.
- I will improve variable names, structure, comments, and consistency.
- Some programs may be extended (e.g., adding input validation, taxes, discounts).

**Goal**
: Build a clean, well-documented beginner repository that reflects both learning and progress.
